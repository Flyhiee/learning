Strictly speaking, the flex-flow property is actually an abbreviation that replaces two other flexbox container properties: flex-direction and flex-wrap.  But the row wrap value is so useful that it will likely be the standard.   

flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>;

The possible values for the flex-direction are: row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse.

The values for the flex-wrap part are: wrap, wrap-reverse, and nowrap.

calc()
The ideal height for the main section is that of the viewport minus the height of the header.  You may remember that the vh unit is a percentage of the viewport.  So 100vh is one hundred percent of the viewport.  And we can see that the height of the header in the CSS above is 100px.  

Wherever a CSS dimension unit is accepted we can also provide the calc() expression. This expression lets us mix units of different types. It looks like this:

main { height: calc(100vh - 100px); }
