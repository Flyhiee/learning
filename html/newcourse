Essential steps in Web internationalization

1. Character encoding declaration
There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and  its value is UTF-8.

Example 1:

<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>

2. Primary language declaration

The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.

Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
