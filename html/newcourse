Essential steps in Web internationalization

1. Character encoding declaration
There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and  its value is UTF-8.

Example 1:

<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>

2. Primary language declaration

The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.

Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>

A minimal HTML5 document

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <title>Page Title</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
... <!-- The rest is content -->
</body>
</html>


The <section>, <article>, <nav> and <aside> elements are called "sectioning elements". They cut a document into slices we call "sections".


<h1>...<h6> are called headings, and define the header of a section (whether explicitly marked up using sectioning content elements, or implied by the heading content itself). This means that:

<body>
    <h1>Title of my document</h1>
    ...
</body>
... defines the header of a section implicitly, while:

<body>
   ...
   <section>
      <h1>Title of my section</h1>
      ...
   </section>
</body>
... defines the heading of the explicit section (its parent element <section>).
