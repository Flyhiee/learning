Essential steps in Web internationalization

1. Character encoding declaration
There is a character encoding declaration near the start of your source code, and  its value is UTF-8.

Example 1:

<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
...
</head>

2. Primary language declaration

The HTML tag has a lang attribute which correctly indicates the language of your content.

Example 2: This indicates that the page is in French.

<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>

A minimal HTML5 document

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <title>Page Title</title>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
... <!-- The rest is content -->
</body>
</html>
