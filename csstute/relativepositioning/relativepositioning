The position property
The "position" property sets the algorithm for how the Web browser will compute the way the HTML elements are placed on the page. There are four different value options for the position property: 

relative - This is the position setting we will be discussing in detail as it is the best way to build on the dynamic layout methods we have learned thus far. This lets you specify where an HTML element should be relative to where it would be by default.
static - This is the default setting and will place an element wherever the web browser computes it should be. 
fixed - This places an element in a specific location within the window. You can use this to set an element to remain where it is regardless of scrolling. This was used heavily when "frames" were popular, however now it should be used very sparingly. 
absolute - This allows you to position elements relative to their containing box. This removes an element from its normal flow (just like a floating element) so it can be difficult to control and make a layout that is truly dynamic.
