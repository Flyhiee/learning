"Elements" are the pieces themselves, i.e. a paragraph is an element, a header is an element, 
even the body is an element. Most elements can contain other elements, as the body element would contain header 
elements, paragraph elements, in fact pretty much all of the visible elements of the Document Object Model 
(that developers refer to as the "DOM").
